The Truelight system is widely utilized in digital intermediate production environments around the world. [Laboratory],2009 (82nd),Scientific and Technical (Technical Achievement Award),To DR. KLAUS ANDERLE, CHRISTIAN BAEKER and FRANK BILLASCH for their contributions to the LUTher 3D look-up table hardware device and color management software. The LUTher system was one of the first color look-up table processors to be widely adopted by the pioneering digital intermediate facilities in the industry. This innovation enabled accurate color presentation by facilities that had analyzed projected film output and built 3D look-up tables in order to emulate print film. [Laboratory],2009 (82nd),Scientific and Technical (Technical Achievement Award),To STEVE SULLIVAN, KEVIN WOOLEY, BRETT ALLEN and COLIN DAVIDSON for the development of the Imocap on-set performance capture system. Developed at Industrial Light & Magic and consisting of custom hardware and software2009 (82nd),Scientific and Technical (Technical Achievement Award),To HAYDEN LANDIS, KEN McGAUGH and HILMAR KOCH for advancing the technique of ambient occlusion rendering. Ambient occlusion has enabled a new level of realism in synthesized imagery and has become a standard tool for computer graphics lighting in motion pictures. [Digital Imaging Technology],2009 (82nd),Scientific and Technical (Technical Achievement Award),To BJoRN HEDeN for the design and mechanical engineering of the silent, two-stage planetary friction drive Heden Lens Motors. Solving a series of problems with one integrated mechanism, this device had an immediate and significant impact on the motion picture industry.
